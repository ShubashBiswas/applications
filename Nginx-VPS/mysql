Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost'

Option 1:

sudo mysql -u root # I had to use "sudo" since it was a new installation

mysql> USE mysql;
mysql> UPDATE user SET plugin='mysql_native_password' WHERE User='root';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
mysql> exit;

sudo service mysql restart


Option 2: (replace YOUR_SYSTEM_USER with the username you have)
sudo mysql -u root # I had to use "sudo" since it was a new installation

mysql> USE mysql;
mysql> CREATE USER 'YOUR_SYSTEM_USER'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWD';
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'YOUR_SYSTEM_USER'@'localhost';
mysql> UPDATE user SET plugin='auth_socket' WHERE User='YOUR_SYSTEM_USER';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
mysql> exit;

sudo service mysql restart

Remember that if you use option #2 you'll have to connect to MySQL as your system username (mysql -u YOUR_SYSTEM_USER).


ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'new-password';

sudo service mysql stop
sudo service mysql start
